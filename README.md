Instructions to Run the Flask App
==================================

1. Open this folder in File Explorer.
2. Double-click `run_server.bat` to start the server.
3. Once started, open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or click on openbrowser.url on the repository.

To stop the server, close the terminal window. This includes the packages needed, hence, the big file size.
